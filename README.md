# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – Aditi Singh

> 🚀 CSE Undergrad | Passionate Full-Stack Developer | Aspiring Software Engineer

Welcome to my DSA journey! This repository documents my consistent practice and learning across key topics like arrays, strings, recursion, two pointers, sliding windows, and more. I'm focused on mastering both **fundamentals** and **interview-level problem solving**.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- ✅ Topic-wise folders (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees)
- ✅ Level-wise practice (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- ✅ Detailed comments, patterns, and optimized solutions
- ✅ Based on questions from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, and Striver’s Sheet

## 💡 Why This Repo?

- To track my daily progress
- To build strong problem-solving intuition
- To prepare for top tech interviews
- To contribute back through clean, readable code

## 📌 Example Topics Covered

- ✅ Arrays & Prefix Sums
- ✅ Hashing & Sliding Windows
- ✅ Two Pointers & Sorting
- ⏳ Coming soon: Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs
